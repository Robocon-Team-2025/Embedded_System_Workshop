# Workshop Schedule
## 1. Introduction to Embedded System
### An embedded system is a combination of hardware and software designed to perform a specific task within a larger system. Unlike general-purpose computers, embedded systems are usually compact, efficient, and tailored for a particular functionâ€”like controlling a microwave, monitoring a car's engine, or managing a smart thermostat. This workshop will guide you through the basics of embedded systems and hands-on work with microcontrollers, helping you turn your ideas into practical solutions!
## 2. What is a microcontroller?
### At the heart of many embedded systems are microcontrollers, such as the ESP32. A microcontroller is a tiny computer on a single chip that includes a processor, memory, and input/output capabilities. The ESP32 is a popular choice because of its built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, making it ideal for IoT (Internet of Things) projects like smart home devices or wearable technology. 
## 3. Arduino vs ESP32
### The ESP32 stands out compared to traditional Arduino boards because of its advanced features and versatility. While Arduino boards like the Uno are excellent for beginners, the ESP32 offers built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities, making it a powerful choice for IoT applications. It has a dual-core processor, faster clock speeds (up to 240 MHz), and more memory, allowing it to handle complex tasks and run multiple processes simultaneously. Additionally, the ESP32 supports a wider range of peripherals, including touch sensors, DACs, and advanced GPIO functions. Despite its advanced features, the ESP32 remains cost-effective, making it an attractive option for projects that require both connectivity and performance.
## 4. Wokwi - Interfacing with basic components
### In this activity, participants will explore the capabilities of the ESP32 by simulating and interfacing it with basic components using Wokwi, a user-friendly online simulator for embedded systems. Participants will begin by simulating an ESP32 microcontroller and learn to control an LED through simple on/off commands. They will then interface a push button to toggle the LED, introducing the concept of digital input. Next, they will control a servo motor, learning how to send PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals to achieve precise movement. This hands-on simulation provides an excellent foundation for understanding how microcontrollers interact with peripherals, all in a safe and accessible virtual environment.
## 5. ESP32 - Using Serial Monitor
### In this activity, participants will use a real ESP32 microcontroller (Limited to Software Aspirant) to learn about serial communication and how to interact with devices through the serial monitor. They will write a simple program to send messages from the ESP32 to their computer via a USB connection and display them on the serial monitor. Participants will then modify the program to receive input from the serial monitor, such as typing commands to control an LED connected to the ESP32. This hands-on activity introduces the basics of serial communication, a fundamental concept for debugging and exchanging data between a microcontroller and other systems. 
## 6. Wokwi - Simple project applying knowledge from previous section  
### In this final activity, participants will apply their knowledge to complete a simple project using the ESP32 in Wokwi. Combining skills learned in previous sections, they will simulate a smart lighting system. The project involves controlling an LED based on button inputs and adding functionality with a servo motor to simulate opening or closing a window shade. Participants will also integrate serial communication to monitor system status or send commands directly through the serial terminal. This activity reinforces key concepts like digital I/O, PWM, and serial communication, while showcasing how these elements come together to create functional embedded systems.
